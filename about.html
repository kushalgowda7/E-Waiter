      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        The E-waiter project is a web-based application that revolutionizes the traditional dining 
        experience by providing a contactless and efficient ordering system for customers in our 
        restaurant. With this, customers can browse through the menu, select their 
        desired items and customize their orders without interacting with the waiter. 
        This ensures that customer orders and preferences are processed quickly and accurately.
         We deliver high quality service and personalized dining experiences to the customers.
